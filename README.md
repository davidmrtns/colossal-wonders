## Description
This project is a Minecraft mod I made for fun, inspired by some of my favorite magical-themed mods. It's built using Fabric for Minecraft 1.20 and combines custom mechanics, visual effects and a bit of lore. The goal is to create a rich and immersive magical experience that feels both mysterious and profound.

Everything here was coded from scratch including the spell system, custom UIs and magical advancement. It's still a work in progress, but I'm having a blast building it!

## Features
- ü™Ñ Magic system based on wands and wand cores (spells);
- üìñ Interactive grimoire with a dynamic knowledge tree;
- ‚ú® Visual effects and custom item models;
- üìö Original lore and worldbuilding (explained throughout the grimoire);
- üéÆ Custom UIs for spell casting and item interaction.

## Development
### Technologies
- **Language**: Java;
- **Framework**: Fabric API;
- **Build system**: Gradle (Loom).
